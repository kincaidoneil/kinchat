The latest version as of writing is 5.2.7, while the version used in kinchat 1.2 is 5.0.0. Instructions to setup the latest version of PHPMailer may be found [here](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/README.md). While there may be some discrepancies in the API, the API of the older version should conincide with much of the current documentaiton.
